4> To clarify why you made this selection:

	# The brief carefully it states that the client wanted to see “An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.
	# As explained in the data model, popularity is quantified by the “Score” given to each reaction type.
	# We therefore need data showing the content ID, category, content type, reaction type, and reaction score.
	# So, to figure out popularity, we’ll have to add up which content categories have the largest score.


5> Clean the data by:

	# removing rows that have values which are missing,
	# changing the data type of some values within a column, and
	# removing columns which are not relevant to this task

6> What we have to do?

	# We recommend using the Reaction table as your base table, then first join the relevant columns from your Content data set, and then the Reaction Types data set.
	# Add up the total scores for each category.
	# A cleaned dataset.
	# The top 5 categories.
	# What was the month with the most posts?

7> Building Presentation:-

	# Agenda - What will your presentation cover?
	# Project Recap - What are the key points from the brief?
	# Problem - What is the problem that you answer in this presentation?
	# The Analytics team - Who is on your team?
		>As a reminder from the earlier task - this includes: Andrew Fleming (Chief Technical Architect), Marcus Rompton (Senior Principle), and yourself!
	# Process - How did you complete your analysis?



8> What I did in the work for the interview purpose:

	# Out of the 7 datasets:- Reaction, Content, Reaction Types, Profil, User. I choose the 3 datasets:- Reaction, Content, Reaction Types.
	# Cleaned the DataSet. 
	# Used VLOOKUP to joing the 3 spreedsheets.
	# Found out the top 5 categories for Social Buzz by using SUMIF function.
